# Hidden Markov review paper
Survey paper on Hidden Markov Model algorithms. Project completed for CS9544, Analysis of Algorithms

Please download the pdf file to read, some notation is lost through the github link.


# K-means Clustering

Python Code that incorporates hard K-means clustering. Note, the number of random distributions, number of clusters, and other parameters are left to the reader to experiement with.
For further reference on the mathematical details, refer to "Lecture Notes on Data Science: K-Means Clustering" by Christian Bauckhage, on researchgate.com.

For any questions or concerns regarding the code, you can email me at lsehovac@uwo.ca


# Principal Component Analysis

Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on NBA player data.
Note that the dataset is provided (obtained from Kaggle.com).

Everything coded from scratch.
Both the Covariance and Iterative method are provided in the same python code, namely pca_nba.py

The Covariance method is best used when the dataset is small (small number of features), while the
Iterative method is best used when the dataset is large (large number of features).

There are a few notes at the bottom of pca_nba.py, please read those as well.
For more information on PCA, the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis
provides good information, as well as good references to valuable papers on PCA (such as 
http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc453/student_tutorials/principal_components.pdf ).
